# Purpose of Voting Smart Contract

A smart contract vote can be simple or complex, depending on the requirements of the elections you wish to support. Voting can be on a small number of pre-selected proposals (or candidates), or on a potentially large number of proposals suggested dynamically by the voters themselves.

In this framework, you will write a smart contract for a small organisation. Voters, who are all known to the organisation, are whitelisted using their Ethereum address, can submit new proposals in a proposal registration session, and can vote on the proposals in the voting session.

‚úîÔ∏è Voting is not secret 

‚úîÔ∏è Each voter can see the votes of others

‚úîÔ∏è The winner is determined by a simple majority

‚úîÔ∏è The proposal with the most votes wins.


## üëâ The voting process: 

The entire voting process is as follows:

- The voting administrator registers a blank list of voters identified by their Ethereum address.
- The voting administrator starts the proposal registration session.
- Registered voters are allowed to register their proposals while the registration session is active.
- The voting administrator ends the proposal registration session.
- Voting administrator starts the voting session.
- Registered voters vote for their preferred proposal.
- The voting administrator ends the voting session.
- The voting administrator counts the votes.
- Everyone can check the final details of the winning proposal.
